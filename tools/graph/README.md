# @forepath/graph

Nx plugin that builds a **knowledge graph** of this monorepo from:

- the Nx project graph (projects + `depends_on`; `tools/*` as `tool`)
- app/lib → tool links from `project.json` references (executor ids, package names, implicitDependencies, `tools/<name>` paths)
- production npm packages attributed to apps via Nx `createPackageJson`
- patch-package files under `patches/` (when they target attributed packages)
- OpenAPI / AsyncAPI specs under project roots
- Markdown docs under `docs/<domain>/`
- Architectural TypeScript sources (controllers, gateways, jobs, services, repositories, entities, DTOs, guards, modules, domain providers)
- Accumulated NgRx `state` slice folders (linked to matching `*.service.ts`)
- Accumulated email templates (`*.template.html` / `*.template.txt`)
- Outbound webhook / notification events from `*notification.events.ts`
- NestJS controller ↔ OpenAPI and gateway ↔ AsyncAPI `implements` heuristics

## Generate

```bash
# Preferred (used by pre-commit): build plugin then write graph/
nx run graph:generate-kg

# Or via Nx generator
nx generate @forepath/graph:generate-kg
```

Outputs (committed; refreshed on every pre-commit):

- `graph/graph.json` — nodes and edges
- `graph/graph.html` — simple local viewer (open next to `graph.json`)

Options for the CLI / generator:

- `--outDir=graph` (default)
- `--skipHtml`

## View in the browser

`graph.html` loads `graph.json` via `fetch`, so open it over HTTP (not as a `file://` URL):

```bash
nx run graph:serve
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:4211/](http://127.0.0.1:4211/). Optional flags:

```bash
nx run graph:serve -- --port=4300
nx run graph:serve -- --dir=graph
```

## Query / MCP / impact

Prefer recipe tools over loading `graph.json` into an LLM:

```bash
nx run graph:build

# CLI
nx run graph:query -- r1 decabill-backend-feature-billing-manager
nx run graph:query -- endpoint --method POST --path /auth/register
nx run graph:impact -- --base main
nx run graph:query -- mentions shared-backend-feature-notifications

# MCP (stdio) — registered via .agenstra/mcp-definitions/knowledge-graph.mcp.json
# Launcher builds dist on demand if missing:
#   node tools/graph/mcp-run.cjs
nx run graph:mcp
```

MCP tools: `graph_r1`, `graph_docs`, `graph_endpoint`, `graph_search`, `graph_impact`, `graph_mentions`.

## Pre-commit

[`.husky/pre-commit`](../../.husky/pre-commit) runs `nx run graph:generate-kg` and `git add`s the artifacts so they are included in the same commit automatically. If the graph content is unchanged aside from `generatedAt`, `graph.json` is not rewritten (so Git stays clean).
