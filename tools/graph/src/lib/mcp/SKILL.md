# Knowledge Graph Skill

Prefer the **knowledge-graph MCP** (or `nx run graph:query`) over loading `graph/graph.json` into context or scanning the whole repo. Use the recipes below as **repeatable patterns** — do not invent ad-hoc traversals when a recipe fits.

## Operating rules

1. **Read before large change** — before refactoring a project, moving APIs, or touching cross-domain flows, run the matching recipe and summarize findings first.
2. **MCP first** — call `graph_r1` / `graph_endpoint` / `graph_docs` / `graph_impact` / `graph_mentions` / `graph_search` instead of grepping or pasting `graph.json`.
3. **Query, then open files** — resolve owning projects, specs, and docs from recipe results; only then read source under each project's `root`.
4. **Stale tree** — if the working tree changed since the last commit and the task depends on structure, run `nx run graph:generate-kg` first. MCP launcher builds `dist` on demand if missing; rebuild explicitly after graph tool source changes (`nx run graph:build`).
5. **Missing edges are normal** — fall back to source when `implements` / `documents` are absent; do not invent links.
6. **Declared vs mentions** — `depends_on` / `graph_r1` = build & boundary blast radius. For textual/copy-paste consumers, run `graph_mentions` after R1 (soft references).
7. **Client stubs** — `.cursor/skills/graph/SKILL.md` and `.opencode/skills/graph/SKILL.md` are thin discovery stubs only; full recipes live here and on the MCP prompt `graph` / resource `skill://graph`.

## MCP tools (preferred)

| Tool             | Recipe   | Use                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `graph_r1`       | R1       | Blast radius for `project`                               |
| `graph_docs`     | R2       | Doc concepts / `docPath`s for a project                  |
| `graph_endpoint` | R3       | Owners / implementers / callers for HTTP path or channel |
| `graph_search`   | R5       | Keyword over typed graph nodes                           |
| `graph_impact`   | impact   | Diff/path list → owning projects → R1 each               |
| `graph_mentions` | mentions | Soft textual references outside `depends_on`             |

CLI equivalents (same JSON payloads):

```bash
nx run graph:build
nx run graph:query -- r1 <project>
nx run graph:query -- docs <project>
nx run graph:query -- endpoint --method POST --path /example/resource
nx run graph:query -- search <keyword>
nx run graph:impact -- --base main
nx run graph:query -- mentions <project>
```

## Generating / viewing

Pre-commit regenerates and stages `graph/graph.json` + `graph/graph.html` via `nx run graph:generate-kg`. `graph.json` is left untouched when only `generatedAt` would change (Git stays clean).

```bash
nx run graph:generate-kg          # refresh artifacts
nx run graph:serve                # http://127.0.0.1:4211/ (not file://)
```

Attrs of interest: project `root`, `tags`, `targets`, `domain`, `context`, `featureGroup`; cluster `name`, `kind`, `label`, `source`; file `path`, `languageOrKind`, `projectName`; state `sliceName`, `memberFiles`; email `templateName`, `memberFiles`; webhook-event `eventName`, `catalogPath`; endpoint / channel `method`, `pathOrChannel`, `operationId`, `specKind`; concept `title`, `docPath`, `domain`.

## How to query

Prefer MCP/CLI recipes above. If you must read `graph/graph.json` directly, use targeted search (ripgrep / structured JSON tools) — never load the whole file into context.

- **By id prefix:** `project:`, `tool:`, `package:`, `patch:`, `domain:`, `context:`, `feature-group:`, `file:`, `api:HTTP:`, `api:channel:`, `webhook-event:`, `concept:`
- **By type:** filter `nodes` where `type` is `app` \| `lib` \| `tool` \| `package` \| `patch` \| `controller` \| `service` \| `repository` \| `entity` \| `dto` \| `provider` \| `email` \| `webhook-event` \| `state` \| `endpoint` \| `channel` \| …
- **Outgoing edges:** `edges` with `from === <id>`
- **Incoming edges:** `edges` with `to === <id>`
- **By edge type:** filter `edges` where `type` is `depends_on` \| `contains` \| `implements` \| `injects` \| `provides` \| `calls` \| `documents` \| `belongs_to`

## Recipes

### Impact — Before reviewing or landing a diff

Goal: map changed files to projects and blast radius.

1. Call `graph_impact` with `baseRef` (e.g. `main`) and/or explicit `paths`, or uncommitted changes by default.
2. Summarize owning projects, shared deps, and linked `docPath`s.
3. Optionally `graph_mentions` on heavily shared libs for soft consumers.
4. Open only the listed roots / docs.

### R1 — Before changing project `X`

Goal: blast radius and related docs/APIs before editing.

1. Call `graph_r1` with the Nx project name (preferred), or locate `project:<X>` manually.
2. List **outgoing** `depends_on` (what X imports) and **incoming** `depends_on` (who depends on X).
3. Follow **outgoing** `contains` → `openapi` / `asyncapi` / `controller` / `gateway` / `service` / `entity` / `provider` / `email` / `webhook-event` / `state` / `diagram` / `readme` owned by X.
4. From those files, follow `contains` → `endpoint` / `channel` nodes (API surface of X).
5. From `controller` / `gateway` / `service` nodes, follow outgoing `injects` (and from `module` follow `provides`).
6. For frontend data-access projects: `state` → `injects` → HTTP `service` → `calls` → `endpoint`.
7. Collect **incoming** `documents` where `to` is `project:<X>` or any of those endpoints / channels → open each concept's `docPath`.
8. Only then open source under attrs.`root`.

**Sample caps:** `graph_r1` / impact-embedded R1 return **truncated sample lists** for token budget. Prefer `endpointCount`, `channelCount`, `documentCount`, and `containsTotals` for sizes. Do **not** treat `.length` of `endpoints` / `channels` / `documents` / `containsByType[*]` as complete. Every R1 payload includes `samples.note` and `samples.caps` describing the limits.

### R2 — Find all docs touching project `Y`

Goal: every curated doc concept that references Y.

1. Start at `project:<Y>`.
2. Take all edges with `type === "documents"` and `to === "project:<Y>"`.
3. For each `from` (`concept:…`), read attrs.`title`, `docPath`, `sectionAnchor`.
4. Optionally expand: endpoints / channels contained by Y (R1 steps 3–4), then incoming `documents` to those surfaces.
5. Ignore `readme` nodes for this recipe unless you need project-local READMEs; concepts come only from `doc` markdown under `docs/`.

### R3 — Before changing an HTTP path or channel

Goal: owners, implementers, and docs for one API surface.

1. Find `endpoint` (`api:HTTP:<METHOD>:<path>`) or `channel` (`api:channel:<name>`) by id or by attrs.`pathOrChannel` / `operationId`.
2. Incoming `contains` → owning `openapi` / `asyncapi` file → incoming `contains` → owning `project:…`.
3. Incoming `implements` → `controller` / `gateway` and/or `project:…` (may be empty — heuristic).
4. Incoming `calls` → frontend HTTP services that hit this endpoint (when present).
5. From controllers/gateways, outgoing `injects` → wired services/repositories (Nest DI); from services, further `injects`.
6. Incoming `documents` → concepts; open `docPath`.
7. Sibling surfaces: other `contains` children of the same spec file.

### R4 — Before a cross-service / cross-domain change

Goal: shared libs and documentation bridges between apps.

1. Resolve each involved project's `domain` / `context` via attrs or outgoing `belongs_to`.
2. Start from `domain:<name>` nodes; take **incoming** `belongs_to` for member projects, docs, and concepts.
3. For each member project, run R1 (deps + contained specs).
4. Intersect dependency neighborhoods: shared `lib` projects on paths between the apps (often under `domain:shared`).
5. Summarize: domains involved, shared libraries, shared endpoints / channels, and doc concepts that bind the change together.

### R5 — Map a feature area by keyword

Goal: discover related endpoints and docs when you only have a term (e.g. resource name).

1. Search node ids and attrs (`pathOrChannel`, `operationId`, `summary`, `title`, `path`, `docPath`, cluster `name`) for the keyword.
2. Classify hits: `endpoint` / `channel` vs `concept` vs `doc`/`readme` vs `project` vs `controller`/`service`/`state` vs `domain`/`context`/`feature-group`.
3. For each `endpoint` / `channel` hit → R3. For each `project` hit → R1. For each `concept` hit → follow outgoing `documents`. For each cluster hit → incoming `belongs_to`.
4. Deduplicate projects and `docPath`s before reading source.

### R6 — Trace who implements an OpenAPI/AsyncAPI file

1. Find the `openapi` or `asyncapi` node (`file:…/openapi.yaml` etc.).
2. Incoming `contains` from `project:…` → owner.
3. Outgoing `contains` → all `endpoint` / `channel` children.
4. For each surface node, incoming `implements` → controllers/gateways/projects.
5. Surfaces with no `implements` edge need a manual controller/spec check.

### R7 — Domain map for product `D`

Goal: everything in one product domain.

1. Open `domain:<D>` (type `domain`).
2. Incoming `belongs_to` → member `app`/`lib` projects, `doc` files, and `concept`s.
3. For projects, also note `context` and `featureGroup` attrs (or their `belongs_to` targets).
4. Optional: filter members by `context:frontend` / `context:backend` or `feature-group:feature`.
5. Then apply R1/R2 on the projects you care about.

## Edge cases

- **No docs for a project** — use project + source + endpoint / channel nodes; read source under `root`.
- **Weak `implements`** — dynamic Nest routes or gateway namespaces may not match; open the controller/gateway and spec. Gateways match AsyncAPI channels by **namespace** (incl. `process.env.X \|\| 'literal'`), not bare `@SubscribeMessage` across namespaces.
- **Weak `injects`** — constructor type annotations on controllers/gateways/services/jobs/providers; facade `inject(Service)` on NgRx state; `@Inject('token')` skipped. Prefer same-project class matches.
- **Weak `provides` / `calls`** — module metadata identifiers and HttpClient template paths only; dynamic URLs and string tokens may be missing.
- **NgRx state** — one `state` node per `…/state/<slice>/` folder; matching `<slice>.service.ts` is linked via `contains`; facade `inject()` adds `injects`.
- **Emails** — one `email` node per template stem (`invoice-issued.template.html` + `.txt`); partials and `*-pdf.template.*` are skipped.
- **Providers** — backend `*.provider.ts` and payment `*.processor.ts` under `*/processors/`; frontend DI `*.providers.ts` / `*.provider.ts` are excluded.
- **Webhook events** — individual events from `*notification.events.ts` catalogs (`webhook-event:<project>:<name>`).
- **Tools** — Nx projects under `tools/` are typed `tool`; non-Nx dirs like `tools/ci` get `tool:<name>` nodes. Apps/libs that reference a tool in `project.json` (executor plugin id, package name, `implicitDependencies`, or `tools/<name>` path) get `depends_on` → that tool.
- **Packages** — production npm deps attributed to **apps only** via Nx `createPackageJson` (same as SBOM / `generatePackageJson`). Not from the root lockfile alone.
- **Patches** — `patches/*.patch` linked to an existing `package` node when present; orphan patches are skipped.
- **Stale graph** — regenerate before architecture reviews on a dirty tree.
- **Secrets** — graph stores paths and API metadata only, never `.env` values or credentials.
- **Mentions vs `depends_on`** — Code may _mention_ a lib without an Nx edge. `graph_r1` answers declared coupling; `graph_mentions` lists soft file hits and `softReferenceProjects`. Bare tokens shorter than 8 characters are omitted from mention patterns (use `tools/<name>` / the package `name` from `package.json` instead). Cache/fixture paths (`.angular`, `vite/deps`, `__fixtures__`) are excluded.
- **MCP binary** — Cursor/OpenCode should start `tools/graph/mcp-run.cjs` (builds `dist/tools/graph/src/mcp.js` if missing). After editing graph tool sources, run `nx run graph:build` (or restart MCP so a fresh require picks up dist).
- **Fixtures** — `__fixtures__` directories are not indexed into `graph/graph.json` (keeps tool test sandboxes out of product blast radius).
