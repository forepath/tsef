# Agenstra

**A centralized control plane for managing distributed AI agent infrastructure.**

Agenstra is a full-stack platform that enables you to manage multiple AI agent instances from a single web-based console. Connect to remote agent-manager services, interact with AI agents in real-time, edit code directly in containers, and automate server provisioning—all from one unified interface.

## What is Agenstra?

Agenstra provides a complete solution for managing distributed AI agent infrastructure:

- **Centralized Management** - Connect to and control multiple remote agent-manager services from a single console
- **Real-time AI Interaction** - WebSocket-based bidirectional communication with AI agents for instant responses
- **Integrated Code Editor** - Edit files directly in agent containers with Monaco Editor—read, write, and manage code in real-time
- **Automated Server Provisioning** - Provision cloud servers (Hetzner Cloud, DigitalOcean) with automated Docker and agent-manager deployment
- **Version Control Integration** - Full Git operations (status, branches, commit, push, pull, rebase) directly from the web interface
- **Container Management** - Monitor and interact with agent containers, view logs, and manage container lifecycle
- **VNC Browser Access** - Graphical browser access via VNC with XFCE4 desktop and Chromium browser
- **CI/CD Pipeline Management** - Configure, trigger, and monitor deployment pipelines from the console

## Architecture

Agenstra follows a three-tier distributed architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Frontend Console   │  Angular application with NgRx state management
│  (Web-based IDE)    │  Monaco Editor, Chat Interface, File Management
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ HTTP REST API
           │ WebSocket (Socket.IO)
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Agent Controller   │  Centralized control plane
│ (Backend)           │  Client management, event forwarding
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ HTTP REST API
           │ WebSocket (Socket.IO)
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Agent Manager       │  Agent lifecycle management
│ (Backend)           │  Container management, Docker integration
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Components

- **Frontend Agent Console** - Web-based IDE and chat interface built with Angular and NgRx
- **Backend Agent Controller** - Centralized control plane for managing multiple agent-manager instances
- **Backend Agent Manager** - Agent management system with HTTP REST API and WebSocket gateway

## Key Features

### ✅ Distributed Agent Management

Connect to and manage multiple remote agent-manager services from a single console. Each client represents a remote agent-manager instance that can be provisioned automatically or connected manually.

### ✅ Real-time AI Chat

WebSocket-based bidirectional communication with AI agents. Send messages, receive instant responses, and maintain chat history across reconnections.

### ✅ Integrated Code Editor

Monaco Editor integration allows you to edit files directly in agent containers. Read, write, and manage code in real-time with syntax highlighting and code completion.

### ✅ Automated Server Provisioning

Provision cloud servers (Hetzner Cloud, DigitalOcean) with automated Docker installation and agent-manager deployment. Configure authentication, Git repositories, and agent settings during provisioning.

### ✅ Version Control Integration

Full Git operations directly from the web interface:

- View git status and branches
- Stage, commit, and push changes
- Pull and rebase operations
- Resolve merge conflicts

### ✅ Container Management

Monitor agent containers, view logs, and manage container lifecycle. Real-time container statistics and health monitoring.

### ✅ VNC Browser Access

Access a Chromium browser running in a virtual workspace container via VNC. XFCE4 desktop environment with auto-started browser, accessible through a web-based noVNC client.

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline Management

Configure CI/CD providers (GitHub Actions), trigger pipeline runs, monitor their status, and view logs directly from the Agenstra console.

## Quick Start

### Getting Started

1. **Set up your environment** - Follow the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/agenstra/getting-started.md) to install and configure Agenstra
