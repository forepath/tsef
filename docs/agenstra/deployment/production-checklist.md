# Production Deployment Checklist

Comprehensive checklist for deploying Agenstra to production.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Configuration

- ✅ `NODE_ENV=production` is set for all applications
- ✅ `CORS_ORIGIN` is configured with your production domain(s)
- ✅ `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true` (or leave unset, defaults to `true` in production)
- ✅ `RATE_LIMIT_LIMIT` is set to an appropriate value for your use case
- ✅ `STATIC_API_KEY` or Keycloak credentials are configured
- ✅ Database credentials are secure and not using defaults
- ✅ `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set for sensitive data encryption (agent-controller)

### Security

- ✅ All default passwords are changed
- ✅ API keys are strong and unique
- ✅ Keycloak is properly configured (if using)
- ✅ HTTPS/WSS is enabled for all connections
- ✅ CORS is restricted to specific origins
- ✅ Rate limiting is enabled
- ✅ Database connections use SSL/TLS
- ✅ Docker socket permissions are restricted (if applicable)

### Database

- ✅ PostgreSQL is configured with proper credentials
- ✅ Database backups are configured
- ✅ Database connection pooling is optimized
- ✅ Database migrations are tested
- ✅ Database indexes are optimized

### Infrastructure

- ✅ Docker is properly configured
- ✅ Docker socket is securely mounted (agent-manager)
- ✅ Container resource limits are set
- ✅ Logging is configured
- ✅ Monitoring is set up
- ✅ Health checks are configured

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- Use strong API keys or Keycloak with proper configuration
- Enable token expiration and refresh
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS for all API communications

### Network Security

- Restrict CORS to specific origins
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Enable rate limiting
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure database connections
- Protect credentials and API keys
- Implement proper access controls

## Performance Optimization

### Database

- Configure connection pooling
- Optimize database queries
- Add appropriate indexes
- Monitor query performance

### Application

- Enable production mode optimizations
- Configure caching where appropriate
- Optimize container resource allocation
- Monitor application performance

### Network

- Use CDN for frontend assets
- Enable HTTP/2
- Configure proper timeouts
- Monitor network latency

## Monitoring Setup

### Application Monitoring

- Set up application performance monitoring (APM)
- Configure error tracking
- Monitor API response times
- Track WebSocket connection health

### Infrastructure Monitoring

- Monitor container resource usage
- Track database performance
- Monitor network traffic
- Set up alerting

### Logging

- Centralize logs
- Configure log rotation
- Set up log aggregation
- Monitor for errors

## Backup Strategies

### Database Backups

- Configure automated database backups
- Test backup restoration
- Store backups securely
- Set up backup retention policies

### Configuration Backups

- Backup environment configurations
- Version control configuration files
- Document configuration changes
- Test configuration restoration

## Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment**
   - Review and test all changes
   - Run full test suite
   - Check security vulnerabilities
   - Review configuration

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Test staging deployment
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor deployment

3. **Post-deployment**
   - Verify all services are running
   - Check health endpoints
   - Monitor logs for errors
   - Test critical functionality

## Rollback Plan

- Document rollback procedures
- Test rollback process
- Keep previous versions available
- Have rollback scripts ready
