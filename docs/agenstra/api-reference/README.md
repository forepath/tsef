# API Reference

Complete API specifications for Agenstra's backend services. All specifications are available in OpenAPI 3.1.0 (for HTTP REST APIs) and AsyncAPI 3.0.0 (for WebSocket gateways) formats.

## Agent Controller API

The Agent Controller provides a centralized control plane for managing multiple distributed agent-manager instances.

### HTTP REST API

**OpenAPI Specification**: [openapi.yaml](/spec/agent-controller/openapi.yaml)

- **View in Swagger Editor**: [Open in Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://docs.agenstra.com/spec/agent-controller/openapi.yaml)
- **Download**: [openapi.yaml](/spec/agent-controller/openapi.yaml)

The Agent Controller HTTP API provides:

- Client management (CRUD operations)
- Proxied agent operations (create, update, delete agents)
- Proxied file operations (read, write, create, delete files)
- Proxied version control operations (git status, branches, commit, push, pull, rebase)
- Server provisioning (Hetzner Cloud, DigitalOcean)

### WebSocket Gateway

**AsyncAPI Specification**: [asyncapi.yaml](/spec/agent-controller/asyncapi.yaml)

- **View in AsyncAPI Studio**: [Open in AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/?url=https://docs.agenstra.com/spec/agent-controller/asyncapi.yaml)
- **Download**: [asyncapi.yaml](/spec/agent-controller/asyncapi.yaml)

The Agent Controller WebSocket gateway provides:

- Client context management (`setClient` event)
- Event forwarding to remote agent-manager instances
- Reconnection handling and status notifications

## Agent Manager API

The Agent Manager provides agent lifecycle management and container execution.

### HTTP REST API

**OpenAPI Specification**: [openapi.yaml](/spec/agent-manager/openapi.yaml)

- **View in Swagger Editor**: [Open in Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://docs.agenstra.com/spec/agent-manager/openapi.yaml)
- **Download**: [openapi.yaml](/spec/agent-manager/openapi.yaml)

The Agent Manager HTTP API provides:

- Agent management (CRUD operations)
- File system operations (read, write, create, delete, move files)
- Version control operations (git status, branches, commit, push, pull, rebase)
- Configuration endpoints

### WebSocket Gateway

**AsyncAPI Specification**: [asyncapi.yaml](/spec/agent-manager/asyncapi.yaml)

- **View in AsyncAPI Studio**: [Open in AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/?url=https://docs.agenstra.com/spec/agent-manager/asyncapi.yaml)
- **Download**: [asyncapi.yaml](/spec/agent-manager/asyncapi.yaml)

The Agent Manager WebSocket gateway provides:

- Agent authentication (`login` event)
- Real-time chat communication (`chat` event, `chatMessage` broadcast)
- File update notifications (`fileUpdate`, `fileUpdateNotification`)
- Terminal session management (`createTerminal`, `terminalInput`, `terminalOutput`, `closeTerminal`)
- Container statistics broadcasting (`containerStats`)

## Using the Specifications

### Swagger Editor

[Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) is an online tool for viewing and editing OpenAPI specifications. Use it to:

- Explore API endpoints interactively
- Generate client SDKs
- Validate API contracts
- Test API operations

### AsyncAPI Studio

[AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/) is an online tool for viewing and editing AsyncAPI specifications. Use it to:

- Visualize WebSocket event flows
- Understand message schemas
- Generate documentation
- Validate AsyncAPI contracts

## Generated Client Packages

Pre-built client SDKs are automatically generated from the OpenAPI specifications and published to GitHub Packages. These clients provide type-safe, language-specific interfaces for interacting with the Agenstra APIs.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Clients

JavaScript and TypeScript client packages are published to GitHub Packages npm registry and can be installed using npm or yarn.

**Agent Manager Client**: `@forepath/agenstra-agent-manager-client`

**Agent Controller Client**: `@forepath/agenstra-agent-controller-client`

The TypeScript clients are built with Axios and include full type definitions and interfaces. All clients support configurable base URLs for flexible endpoint configuration.

### Installing Clients

To install the published clients, configure your package manager to use GitHub Packages:

- **npm/yarn**: Configure `@forepath` scope to use GitHub Packages registry in your `.npmrc`

All clients are automatically generated and published with each release, ensuring they stay in sync with the latest API specifications.
