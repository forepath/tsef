# Architecture Documentation

This section covers the architectural principles, patterns, and structural decisions that guide Agenstra. Understanding these concepts helps you deploy, integrate, and operate the control plane and agent-manager hosts.

## Overview

Agenstra follows a **three-tier distributed architecture** for centralized management of multiple remote agent-manager instances. The stack is built on:

- **Domain-driven modules** with clear separation of concerns
- **RESTful HTTP APIs** for synchronous operations
- **WebSocket (Socket.IO)** for real-time bidirectional communication
- **Container-based agent execution** using Docker
- **State management** with NgRx on the frontend

## Documentation Structure

### [Data Flow](./data-flow.md)

Communication patterns and data flow:

- HTTP REST API flows
- WebSocket event flows
- Authentication flows
- State management (NgRx)

## Key Architectural Concepts

### Three-Tier Architecture

Agenstra uses a three-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend Tier**: Angular application with NgRx state management
2. **Controller Tier**: Centralized control plane for managing multiple agent-manager instances
3. **Manager Tier**: Agent lifecycle management and container execution

### Communication Patterns

- **HTTP REST API**: Synchronous operations (CRUD, file operations, Git operations)
- **WebSocket (Socket.IO)**: Real-time bidirectional communication (chat, events, logs)
- **Event Forwarding**: Controller forwards events between frontend and manager

### Authentication & Authorization

- **HTTP Endpoints**: Keycloak OAuth2 or API key authentication
- **WebSocket**: Database-backed authentication (agents) or client context (controller)
- **Token Caching**: OAuth2 tokens are cached for efficiency

### State Management

- **Frontend**: NgRx (Actions, Reducers, Effects, Selectors, Facades)
- **Backend**: In-memory state for WebSocket sessions and token caching
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent data (clients, agents, credentials)

## Architecture Principles

### Scalability

- **Distributed Architecture**: Multiple agent-manager instances can be managed from a single controller
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Agent-managers can be scaled independently
- **Stateless Design**: Frontend and controller are stateless (state in database)

### Maintainability

- **Clear Separation**: Each tier has distinct responsibilities
- **Modular Design**: Libraries can be used independently
- **Consistent Patterns**: Same patterns across all components

### Security

- **Authentication**: Multiple authentication methods (Keycloak, API key)
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS and WSS in production
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and encryption

See **[Security documentation](../security/README.md)** for the accepted-risk register, CRA- and BSI-oriented transparency notes, and operational controls.

### Reliability

- **Reconnection Handling**: Automatic reconnection with state restoration
- **Error Handling**: Error handling and recovery
- **Health Monitoring**: Container health checks and monitoring
