# Version Control

Full Git operations directly from the web interface. View status, manage branches, commit, push, pull, and resolve conflicts.

## Overview

Version control enables you to perform Git operations directly in agent containers. All operations are performed in the container's workspace, which contains a cloned Git repository.

## Git Operations

### View Status

View the current Git status:

- Current branch
- Modified files
- Staged files
- Untracked files
- Unpushed commits

### Manage Branches

- List all branches (local and remote)
- Create new branches
- Switch between branches
- Delete branches
- View branch information

### Stage and Unstage Files

- Stage individual files
- Stage all files
- Unstage files
- View staged changes

### Commit Changes

- Commit staged changes
- Write commit messages
- View commit history
- See commit details

### Push and Pull

- Push changes to remote
- Pull changes from remote
- Fetch changes from remote
- Force push (with lease)

### Advanced Operations

- Rebase current branch onto another branch
- View file diffs
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Switch branches
