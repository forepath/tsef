# Version Control

Full Git operations directly from the web interface. View status, manage branches, commit, push, pull, and resolve conflicts.

## Overview

Version control enables you to perform Git operations directly in agent containers. All operations are performed in the container's workspace, which contains a cloned Git repository.

## Git Operations

### View Status

View the current Git status:

- Current branch
- Modified files
- Staged files
- Untracked files
- Unpushed commits

### Manage Branches

- List all branches (local and remote)
- Create new branches
- Switch between branches
- Delete branches
- View branch information

### Stage and Unstage Files

- Stage individual files
- Stage all files
- Unstage files
- View staged changes

### Commit Changes

- Commit staged changes
- Write commit messages
- View commit history
- See commit details

### Push and Pull

- Push changes to remote
- Pull changes from remote
- Fetch changes from remote
- Force push (with lease)

### Advanced Operations

- Rebase current branch onto another branch
- View file diffs
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Switch branches

### Workspace and automation helpers

The HTTP API also exposes operator-focused endpoints (on the manager and proxied through the controller):

- **`POST .../vcs/workspace/prepare-clean`** Prepare a clean Git workspace for automated or manual workflows (see OpenAPI for semantics).
- **`POST .../automation/verify-commands`** Validate command configuration used by ticket automation and related flows.

These complement everyday commit/push operations documented above.

    AM->>C: git status
    C-->>AM: Status Output
    AM->>AM: Parse Status
    AM-->>AC: Status Response
    AC-->>F: Status Response
    F->>F: Display Status

    U->>F: Commit Changes
    F->>AC: POST /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/vcs/commit
    AC->>AM: POST /api/agents/:agentId/vcs/commit
    AM->>C: git commit -m "message"
