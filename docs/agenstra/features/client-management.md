# Client Management

Client management enables you to connect to and manage multiple remote agent-manager instances from a single console.

## Overview

A client represents a connection to a remote agent-manager service. You can either:

1. **Connect to an existing agent-manager** - If you already have an agent-manager running
2. **Provision a new server** - Automatically provision a cloud server with agent-manager deployment

## Creating a Client

### Connect to Existing Agent-Manager

1. Navigate to the Clients section in the frontend
2. Click "Add Client"
3. Fill in the client details:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for this client
   - **Endpoint**: The HTTP API endpoint of your agent-manager (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
   - **Authentication Type**: Choose `api_key` or `keycloak`
   - **API Key** (if using API key): The API key for authentication
   - **Keycloak Configuration** (if using Keycloak): Client ID, secret, realm, and auth server URL
   - **Agent WebSocket Port**: Port for agent WebSocket connections (default: `8080`)
4. Click "Create"

The system will:

- Create the client entity in the database
- Verify the connection to the remote agent-manager
- Fetch and store the client configuration (Git repository URL, available agent types)
- Return the client details including the API key (if API_KEY type)

### Provision a New Server

See the [Server Provisioning](./server-provisioning.md) documentation for details on automated server provisioning.

## Client Configuration

Each client includes a `config` field that is automatically fetched from the remote agent-manager:

- **`gitRepositoryUrl`** - The Git repository URL configured on the agent-manager instance
- **`agentTypes`** - Array of available agent provider types (e.g., `['cursor']`)

This configuration allows you to discover which agent types are available on each remote agent-manager instance.

## Managing Clients

### View Clients

- List all clients with their status and configuration
- View client details including endpoint and authentication type
- See available agent types for each client

### Update Client

1. Select a client from the list
2. Click "Update Client"
3. Modify the client details
4. Click "Save"

### Delete Client

1. Select a client from the list
2. Click "Delete Client"
3. Confirm deletion

**Note**: Deleting a client also deletes all stored agent credentials for that client.

## Authentication Types

### API Key Authentication

- **Type**: `api_key`
- **Configuration**: API key is auto-generated or provided
- **Usage**: API key is used for all HTTP requests to the agent-manager
- **Storage**: API key is stored securely in the database

### Keycloak Authentication

- **Type**: `keycloak`
- **Configuration**: Keycloak client ID, secret, realm, and auth server URL
- **Usage**: OAuth2 Client Credentials flow with token caching
- **Token Management**: Tokens are automatically cached and refreshed

## API Endpoints

### Client Management

- `GET /api/clients` - List all clients
- `GET /api/clients/:id` - Get a single client by UUID
- `POST /api/clients` - Create a new client
- `POST /api/clients/:id` - Update an existing client
- `DELETE /api/clients/:id` - Delete a client
