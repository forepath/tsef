# Message Filter Rules

Agenstra supports **regex-based message filter rules** at two levels: **global** rules on the agent controller (synced to workspaces) and **per-agent** rules on each agent manager. Together they control how chat traffic is evaluated, dropped, or flagged before or during agent processing.

## Overview

- **Global rules (controller)**: Stored on the agent controller. Only **administrators** may list, create, update, or delete them via `/api/filter-rules`. Responses include a summary of how rules apply per workspace where relevant (see OpenAPI).
- **Per-agent rules (manager)**: Stored on the agent manager for a specific deployment. CRUD is available at `/api/agents-filters` (and by id) with normal agent-manager HTTP authentication.

The console exposes global rule management on route **`/filters`** (admin guard). Per-agent rules are managed in agent context through the same APIs the UI calls via the controller proxy where applicable.

## Why two tiers?

- **Global**: Organization-wide policies (PII patterns, banned phrases, uniform compliance) pushed consistently across clients/workspaces the controller manages.
- **Per-agent**: Fine tuning for a single agent or team without changing global policy (experimentation, repo-specific jargon).

Rule **priority** and matching semantics are defined in the OpenAPI schemas (`CreateFilterRuleDto`, `CreateRegexFilterRuleDto`, etc.). Dropped and flagged messages contribute to [Usage Statistics](./usage-statistics.md) endpoints.
