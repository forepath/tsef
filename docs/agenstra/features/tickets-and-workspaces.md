# Tickets and Workspaces

Project tickets are workspace-scoped work items stored on the **agent controller**. They support planning, collaboration, optional AI-assisted body generation, workspace migration, and ticket automation with observable runs.

## Overview

- **Workspace** In the API and realtime model, a ticket belongs to a **client** (remote agent-manager instance). The console surfaces this as a workspace when you work with tickets for that client.
- **REST** List, create, read, update, and delete tickets; add comments; read activity; migrate a ticket subtree to another workspace; configure automation; approve or unapprove automation; list runs, inspect a run, and cancel a run. Optional flows include prototype prompts, body-generation sessions, and applying generated bodies (see OpenAPI for request shapes).
- **Realtime** After mutations, the board stays coherent via Socket.IO on the **`tickets`** namespace (same TCP port as the `clients` namespace by default). REST remains the source of truth for full loads and pagination.

## Features

- **Board and filters** List tickets by workspace (`clientId`), status, or parent (including root-only lists).
- **Collaboration** Comments and an activity trail per ticket.
- **Migration** Move a resolved root ticket and its descendants to another workspace (`targetClientId`); realtime emits removals on the source room and upserts on the target room.
- **Automation** Configure per-ticket automation, approve or revoke approval, start and inspect runs, cancel in-flight runs. See [Ticket automation](./ticket-automation.md). The chat UI can also receive controller-originated automation snapshots on the **`clients`** namespace (see AsyncAPI).
- **Chat integration** Without joining `tickets`, chat clients on **`clients`** can still receive `ticketChatTicketUpsert` for ticket metadata updates broadcast to room `client:{clientId}`.

## Architecture

### REST and workspace access

Tickets are authorized like other controller resources: you only see workspaces you can access (global admin, client creator, or `client_users` membership unless using API-key mode). Some automation and configuration operations require **workspace management** rights; failed checks return `403` (see OpenAPI operation descriptions).

### Realtime: tickets namespace

```mermaid

    participant UI as TicketsBoard
    participant Http as Controller REST
    participant Svc as TicketsService
    participant RT as TicketBoardRealtime
    UI->>Http: POST mutation
    Http->>Svc: persist ticket
    Svc->>RT: emitToClient
    RT-->>UI: ticketUpsert to room client
```

After `setClient` on namespace **`tickets`**, the socket joins room `client:{clientId}`. Typical server events include:

- `ticketUpsert`. Full ticket row after create or update
- `ticketRemoved`. Deleted or removed from a workspace (e.g. after migrate)
- `ticketCommentCreated`, `ticketActivityCreated`
- `ticketAutomationUpsert`, `ticketAutomationRunUpsert`, `ticketAutomationRunStepAppended`

## Console entry points

- Routes **`/tickets`** and **`/tickets/:clientId`** (authenticated; active client context required). See [Frontend Agent Console](../applications/frontend-agent-console.md).
