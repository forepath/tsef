# File Management

File system operations in agent containers. Read, write, create, delete, and move files and directories.

## Overview

File management enables you to interact with the file system in agent containers. All operations are performed directly in the container's workspace, which typically contains a cloned Git repository.

## File Operations

### List Directory

Browse the file system structure:

- Navigate through directories
- View files and subdirectories
- See file metadata (size, type)

### Read File

Open and view file contents:

- Read file content
- Display in Monaco Editor
- Syntax highlighting based on file type
- Code completion and IntelliSense

### Write File

Edit and save file contents:

- Edit files in Monaco Editor
- Save changes to the container
- Real-time file updates
- Automatic syntax validation

### Create File or Directory

Create new files or directories:

- Create files with specified content
- Create empty directories
- Set file permissions

### Delete File or Directory

Remove files or directories:

- Delete individual files
- Delete directories (recursive)
- Confirm before deletion

### Move File or Directory

Move or rename files and directories:

- Move files to different locations
- Rename files and directories
- Update file paths

## File Operation Flow

    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant AC as Agent Controller
    participant AM as Agent Manager
    participant C as Container

    U->>F: Read File
    F->>AC: GET /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/files/:path
    AC->>AM: GET /api/agents/:agentId/files/:path
    AM->>C: Read File
    C-->>AM: File Content
    AM-->>AC: File Response
    AC-->>F: File Response
    F->>F: Display in Editor

    U->>F: Save File
    F->>AC: PUT /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/files/:path
    AC->>AM: PUT /api/agents/:agentId/files/:path
    AM->>C: Write File
    C-->>AM: Success
    AM->>AM: Notify Other Clients (fileUpdate)
    AM-->>AC: File Response
    AC-->>F: File Response
    F->>F: Show Success
```

## Real-time File Updates

When a file is modified, other connected clients are notified via WebSocket:

```typescript
{
  event: 'fileUpdate',
  payload: {
    agentId: 'agent-uuid',
    path: '/path/to/file'
  }
}
```

This enables real-time collaboration and ensures all clients see the latest file state.

## API Endpoints

### File Operations

- `GET /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/files` - List directory contents
- `GET /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/files/:path` - Read file content
- `POST /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/files/:path` - Create file or directory
- `PUT /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/files/:path` - Write file content
- `DELETE /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/files/:path` - Delete file or directory
- `PATCH /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/files/:path` - Move file or directory
