# Chat Interface

AI chat functionality with real-time responses. Send messages to agents and receive instant responses.

## Overview

The chat interface enables real-time bidirectional communication with AI agents. Messages are sent via WebSocket and responses are received instantly. Chat history is automatically maintained and restored on reconnection.

## Features

### Real-time Communication

- Send messages to agents
- Receive instant responses
- View chat history
- Markdown rendering
- Code block syntax highlighting

### Message Types

#### User Messages

Messages sent by the user to the agent:

```typescript
{
  from: 'user',
  text: 'Hello, agent!',
  timestamp: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'
}
```

#### Agent Messages

Responses from the agent:

```typescript
{
  from: 'agent',
  response: {
    type: 'text',
    result: 'Hello, user!'
  },
  timestamp: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'
}
```

### Chat History

- Chat history is automatically saved
- History is restored on reconnection
- History is cleared when switching agents
- Old events are cleared to prevent duplicates
