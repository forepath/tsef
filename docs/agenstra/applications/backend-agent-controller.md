# Backend Agent Controller

NestJS backend application for managing clients and proxying agent operations to remote agent-manager services.

## Purpose

This application provides a centralized control plane for managing multiple distributed agent-manager instances. It enables the creation, management, and real-time interaction with agents across multiple remote agent-manager services through both synchronous HTTP requests and persistent WebSocket connections.

## Features

This application provides:

- **HTTP REST API** Full CRUD operations for client management and proxied agent operations
- **WebSocket Gateway** Real-time bidirectional event forwarding to remote agent-manager services
- **Server Provisioning** Automated cloud server provisioning (Hetzner Cloud, DigitalOcean) with Docker and agent-manager deployment
- **Tickets and Automation** Workspace tickets, migration, and automation APIs with optional ticket board WebSocket namespace
- **Usage Statistics** Aggregated chat, filter, and entity metrics for operators and admins
- **Global Filter Rules** Admin-managed regex policies synced to workspaces
- **Atlassian import** Admin-managed Atlassian site connections and Jira/Confluence import configurations (scheduled and on-demand)
- **Per-Client Permissions** Fine-grained access control with user roles per client (keycloak/users mode)
- **Secure Authentication** API key, Keycloak OAuth2/OIDC, or built-in users (JWT) for HTTP and WebSocket
- **Database Support** PostgreSQL with TypeORM for data persistence
- **Auto Migrations** Automatic database schema migrations on startup
- **Rate Limiting** Configurable rate limiting on all API endpoints
- **CORS Configuration** Production-safe CORS defaults

## Architecture

This application is built using:

- **NestJS** Progressive Node.js framework
- **TypeORM** Object-Relational Mapping for database operations
- **Keycloak** Identity and access management (optional, can use API key)
- **Socket.IO** WebSocket communication
- **PostgreSQL** Database for client and credential storage

The thin Nest application composes **`ClientsModule`** and **`IdentityStatisticsBridgeModule`** from `@forepath/agenstra/backend` and **`MonitoringModule`** from `@forepath/shared/backend`, which bundle client management, ticket and proxy behavior, usage statistics bridging, and health endpoints from the agent-controller implementation.

## API Endpoints

All HTTP endpoints are prefixed with `/api` and protected by Keycloak authentication (or API key authentication if `STATIC_API_KEY` is set).

### Client Management

- `GET /api/clients` - List all clients (filtered by user access in keycloak/users mode; supports `limit` and `offset`)
- `GET /api/clients/:id` - Get a single client by UUID
- `POST /api/clients` - Create a new client (returns API key if API_KEY authentication type)
- `POST /api/clients/:id` - Update an existing client
- `DELETE /api/clients/:id` - Delete a client

### Client User Management (keycloak/users authentication only)

- `GET /api/clients/:id/users` - List users associated with a client
- `POST /api/clients/:id/users` - Add a user to a client by email
- `DELETE /api/clients/:id/users/:relationshipId` - Remove a user from a client

In api-key mode, users do not play a role; these endpoints are not applicable.

### Proxied Agent Operations

- `GET /api/clients/:id/agents` - List all agents for a client
- `GET /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId` - Get a single agent by UUID
- `POST /api/clients/:id/agents` - Create a new agent for a client (returns auto-generated password, saves credentials)

- `DELETE /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId` - Delete an agent (also deletes stored credentials)
- `GET /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/models` - List models for an agent (proxied)

### Proxied agent lifecycle

- `POST /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/start` - Start the agent container (proxied)
- `POST /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/stop` - Stop the agent container (proxied)
- `POST /api/clients/:id/agents/:agentId/restart` - Restart the agent container (proxied)

### Proxied environment variables

For complete API endpoint documentation, request/response schemas, and authentication requirements, see the application and API reference docs linked below.

## WebSocket Gateway

Socket.IO listens on **`WEBSOCKET_PORT`** (default `8081`). Namespaces share the same port and CORS settings (`WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGIN`):

- **`clients`** (default `WEBSOCKET_NAMESPACE` = `clients`), proxy to the selected workspace’s agent-manager; chat, terminals, stats, and controller-originated ticket hints for the chat UI
- **`tickets`** (default `TICKETS_WEBSOCKET_NAMESPACE` = `tickets`), ticket board and automation realtime (see [Tickets and Workspaces](../features/tickets-and-workspaces.md))
- **`pages`** knowledge board realtime (`knowledgeTreeChanged`, `knowledgeRelationChanged`, `knowledgePageActivityCreated`)
- **`status`** per-user notification snapshots/patches (see [WebSocket Communication](../features/websocket-communication.md))

Connect to each namespace explicitly in the client library (e.g. `io(url + '/clients', options)` and `io(url + '/tickets', options)`).

### Authentication

WebSocket connections require authentication via the `Authorization` header (polling) or `handshake.auth.Authorization` (WebSocket transport). The same authentication methods as HTTP apply:

- **API key**: `Bearer <static-api-key>` or `ApiKey <static-api-key>`
- **Keycloak**: `Bearer <keycloak-jwt-token>`
- **Users**: `Bearer <jwt-token>`

Unauthenticated connections are rejected with `connect_error` "Unauthorized". The `setClient` operation enforces per-client authorization: only users with access to the requested client can set that client context. Unauthorized attempts emit an `error` event with message "You do not have access to this client".

### Namespace `clients` (events)

#### Client → Server

- `setClient` - Set the client context for subsequent operations (requires access to the client)
- `forward` - Forward an event to the remote agent-manager WebSocket (same event names as on the manager, e.g. `chat`, `login`)

#### Server → Client

- `setClientSuccess` - Confirmation that client context was set (or already set)
- `forwardAck` - Acknowledgement that a `forward` was accepted
- **Proxied manager events** Responses are re-emitted using their original event names (for example `chatMessage`, `containerStats`, `terminalOutput`) to the initiating socket only
- `remoteDisconnected`, `remoteReconnecting`, `remoteReconnected`, `remoteReconnectError`, `remoteReconnectFailed` - Remote agent-manager link state
- `ticketAutomationRunChatUpsert`, `ticketChatTicketUpsert` - Controller-originated ticket timeline and metadata for chat clients (see AsyncAPI)
- `error` - Error messages

### Namespace `tickets` (events)

Same handshake auth as `clients`. After `setClient` with a workspace id, the socket joins room `client:{clientId}`.

#### Client → Server

- `setClient` - Select workspace for board realtime

#### Server → Client

- `setClientSuccess` - Workspace context set
- `ticketUpsert`, `ticketRemoved`, `ticketCommentCreated`, `ticketActivityCreated`
- `ticketAutomationUpsert`, `ticketAutomationRunUpsert`, `ticketAutomationRunStepAppended`
- `knowledgeRelationChanged` - Linked knowledge relations changed (same payload as pages namespace)
- `error` - Tickets namespace errors

### Namespace `pages` (events)

Same handshake auth as `clients`. After `setClient`, the socket joins room `client:{clientId}`.

#### Client → Server

- `setClient` - Select workspace for knowledge board realtime

#### Server → Client

- `setClientSuccess` - Workspace context set
- `knowledgeTreeChanged`, `knowledgeRelationChanged`, `knowledgePageActivityCreated`
- `error` - Pages namespace errors

For complete WebSocket event specifications and usage examples, see the application and API reference docs linked below.

## Authentication

Authentication is configured via `AUTHENTICATION_METHOD` (or inferred from `STATIC_API_KEY`). See [Authentication Feature](../features/authentication.md) for details.

### HTTP Endpoints

All HTTP endpoints require authentication. The method depends on configuration:

**API Key** (`AUTHENTICATION_METHOD=api-key`):

- Include the API key: `Authorization: Bearer <static-api-key>` or `ApiKey <static-api-key>`
- All permission checks are bypassed

**Keycloak** (`AUTHENTICATION_METHOD=keycloak`):

- Include a valid Keycloak JWT: `Authorization: Bearer <keycloak-jwt-token>`
- Per-client permissions apply (global admin, client creator, or client_users entry)

**Users** (`AUTHENTICATION_METHOD=users`):

- Include a valid JWT from login: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>`
- Per-client permissions apply

### WebSocket Gateway

The WebSocket gateway uses the same authentication as HTTP. Clients must authenticate on connect and set their context using the `setClient` event before forwarding events. Per-client access is enforced on `setClient`.

For detailed authentication requirements, see the [Authentication Feature](../features/authentication.md).

## Rate Limiting

The application implements configurable rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent abuse and protect against DoS attacks.

### Configuration

Rate limiting is configured via environment variables:

- **`RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`** Enable/disable rate limiting
  - Default: `true` in production, `false` in development
- **`RATE_LIMIT_TTL`** Time window in seconds (default: `60`)
- **`RATE_LIMIT_LIMIT`** Maximum number of requests per window (default: `100`)

### Behavior

- **Production**: Rate limiting is **enabled by default** (100 requests per 60 seconds)
- **Development**: Rate limiting is **disabled by default** (allows up to 10,000 requests per window)

### Error Response

When rate limit is exceeded, the API returns:

- **Status Code**: `429 Too Many Requests`
- **Message**: `"Too many requests, please try again later."`

## CORS Configuration

The application implements production-safe CORS defaults to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

### Configuration

CORS is configured via the `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable:

- **`CORS_ORIGIN`** Comma-separated list of allowed origins
  - Example: `"https://agenstra.com,https://app.agenstra.com"`
  - If not set:
    - **Production**: CORS is **disabled** (no origins allowed) - most secure default
    - **Development**: CORS allows **all origins** (`*`) - convenient for local development

### Behavior

- **Production**: CORS is **disabled by default** (empty origins array)
  - **Warning**: If `CORS_ORIGIN` is not set in production, the application will log a warning and CORS will be disabled
  - **Required**: Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to allow specific origins in production

- **Development**: CORS allows **all origins** (`*`) by default

## Outbound client workspace URLs (SSRF)

Requests and WebSocket handshakes to each workspace’s **stored agent-manager base URL** are validated to reduce SSRF and DNS rebinding risk: URL shape, optional hostname allowlist, HTTPS in production, TLS verification (configurable in non-production), and DNS checks on resolved addresses (unless opted out). Variable names align with frontend **`CONFIG_*`** patterns where applicable. See **[Environment configuration](../deployment/environment-configuration.md)** for `CLIENT_ENDPOINT_*` settings (including production requirement for `CLIENT_ENDPOINT_ALLOWED_HOSTS`).

## Environment Variables

See the application docs and environment configuration for complete environment variable documentation.

**Application-specific:** `PORT` - HTTP API port (default: `3100`)

- `WEBSOCKET_PORT` - WebSocket gateway port (default: `8081`; shared by `clients` and `tickets` namespaces)
- `WEBSOCKET_NAMESPACE` - Socket.IO namespace for agent proxying (default: `clients`)
- `TICKETS_WEBSOCKET_NAMESPACE` - Socket.IO namespace for ticket board realtime (default: `tickets`)
- `WEBSOCKET_CORS_ORIGIN` - CORS origin(s) for WebSocket (see framework docs)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment mode (`development` or `production`)

**CORS Configuration:** `CORS_ORIGIN` - Allowed CORS origins (comma-separated list)

**Rate Limiting:** `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` - Enable/disable rate limiting

**Dynamic provider plugins (optional):** `DYNAMIC_PROVISIONING_PROVIDERS` - Extra provisioning packages (critical registry)

- `DYNAMIC_CONTEXT_IMPORT_PROVIDERS` - Extra context import provider packages
- `DYNAMIC_PROVIDERS_FAIL_FAST` - Abort startup on critical provider load errors when `true`
- `DYNAMIC_PROVIDER_PLUGIN_PATH` / `DYNAMIC_PROVIDER_PLUGIN_INSTALL` - Post-build plugin mount and startup install

See [Dynamic provider plugins](../features/dynamic-provider-plugins.md) and [Environment configuration](../deployment/environment-configuration.md).

## Database Setup

The application uses TypeORM and requires a database connection to be configured. See the application docs for database setup requirements and entity schema.

## Docker Deployment

The application includes Dockerfiles for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build API container
nx docker:api agenstra-backend-agent-controller
```

### Running the Container

```bash
# Run with docker-compose (recommended)
cd apps/agenstra/backend-agent-controller
docker compose up -d

# Or run directly
docker run \
  -p 3100:3100 \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -e CORS_ORIGIN="https://agenstra.com" \
  -e RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true \
  -e RATE_LIMIT_LIMIT=100 \
  backend-agent-controller:api
```

The API image uses the same **non-root `agenstra`** user, **restricted `sudo`**, and optional Docker socket hardening as the agent manager when the socket is mounted. See **[Container image security](../security/container-images.md)** and **[Docker deployment](../deployment/docker-deployment.md#container-security-images)**.

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- `CORS_ORIGIN` is configured with your production domain(s)
- `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true` (or leave unset, defaults to `true` in production)
- `RATE_LIMIT_LIMIT` is set to an appropriate value for your use case
- `STATIC_API_KEY` or Keycloak credentials are configured
- Database credentials are secure
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set for sensitive data encryption
