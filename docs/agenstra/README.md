## System Architecture

Agenstra follows a three-tier architecture:

```mermaid
graph TB
    FE["Frontend Console<br/>(Web-based IDE)<br/>Angular, Monaco Editor, Chat, File Management"]
    AC["Agent Controller<br/>(Backend)<br/>Client management, event forwarding"]
    AM["Agent Manager<br/>(Backend)<br/>Container management, Docker integration"]
    FE -->|"HTTP REST API<br/>WebSocket (Socket.IO)"| AC

```

For detailed architecture information, see the [Architecture Documentation](./architecture/README.md).

## Key Features

### Distributed Agent Management

Connect to and manage multiple remote agent-manager services from a single console. Each client represents a remote agent-manager instance that can be provisioned automatically or connected manually.

### Real-time AI Chat

WebSocket-based bidirectional communication with AI agents. Send messages, receive instant responses, and maintain chat history across reconnections.

### Integrated Code Editor

Monaco Editor integration allows you to edit files directly in agent containers. Read, write, and manage code in real time with syntax highlighting and code completion.

### Automated Server Provisioning

Provision cloud servers (Hetzner Cloud, DigitalOcean) with automated Docker installation and agent-manager deployment. Configure authentication, Git repositories, and agent settings during provisioning.

### Version Control Integration

Full Git operations directly from the web interface:

- View git status and branches
- Stage, commit, and push changes
- Pull and rebase operations
- Resolve merge conflicts

### Container Management

Monitor agent containers, view logs, and manage container lifecycle. Real-time container statistics and health monitoring.

### VNC Browser Access

Access a Chromium browser running in a virtual workspace container via VNC. XFCE4 desktop environment with auto-started browser, accessible through a web-based noVNC client.

### Atlassian import

Administrators configure Atlassian site connections and import rules so Jira issues and Confluence pages sync into workspace **tickets** and **knowledge** on the agent controller, with optional scheduling and manual runs. See [Atlassian import](./features/atlassian-import.md).
