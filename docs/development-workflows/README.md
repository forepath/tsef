# Development Workflows Documentation

This section covers the processes, procedures, and workflows that guide how we develop software in our monorepo. These workflows are designed to ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency across all development activities.

## Overview

Our development workflows are built around two core operation modes that handle different types of tasks. Understanding when and how to use these modes is essential for effective development in our structured environment.

## Documentation Structure

### [Getting Started](./getting-started.md)

Your entry point to understanding our development environment, including:

- First steps for new developers
- Understanding operation modes
- Setting up your development environment
- Daily workflow overview

### [Operation Modes](./operation-modes.md)

Detailed guide to our two core development approaches:

- **Plan-First Mode** - For analysis, investigation, and planning tasks
- **Immediate Implementation Mode** - For fixes, features, and direct implementation

### [GitHub Workflow](./github-workflow.md)

Complete guide to our GitHub-based development process:

- Issue management and tracking
- Pull request creation and review
- Branch management and merging
- Release and deployment processes

### [Validation Pipeline](./validation-pipeline.md)

Comprehensive overview of our quality assurance process:

- Automated testing and validation
- Code formatting and linting
- Pre-commit and pre-push checks
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Core Workflow Concepts

### Operation Modes

Our development process uses two distinct modes:

**Plan-First Mode**

- Used for: analysis, investigation, assessment, review, examination, planning
- Process: analyze → plan → present → implement (after approval)
- Best for: complex features, architectural decisions, research tasks

**Immediate Implementation Mode**

- Used for: fixes, implementation, solutions, building, creating, updating
- Process: analyze → implement → test → commit → push
- Best for: bug fixes, small features, straightforward tasks

### Quality Assurance

Every change goes through our validation pipeline:

1. **Code Formatting** - Automated formatting with Prettier
2. **Linting** - Code quality checks with ESLint
3. **Testing** - Unit, integration, and e2e tests
4. **Build Validation** - Ensure all projects build successfully
5. **Pre-push Checks** - Final validation before pushing

### GitHub Integration

Our workflow is tightly integrated with GitHub:

- **Issues** - Track all work and requirements
- **Pull Requests** - Review and merge all changes
- **Branches** - Organize work and enable parallel development
- **Automation** - CI/CD pipelines handle testing and deployment
