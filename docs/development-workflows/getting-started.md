# Getting Started

Welcome to the monorepo! This guide will help you understand how to work effectively within our structured development environment.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll understand:

- How our development workflow operates
- The two main operation modes for different types of tasks
- How to structure your work for maximum efficiency
- Where to find help when you need it

## Your First Steps

### 1. Understand Operation Modes

Our development process uses two distinct operation modes:

- **[Plan-First Mode](./operation-modes.md#plan-first-mode)** - For analysis, investigation, and planning
- **[Immediate Implementation Mode](./operation-modes.md#immediate-implementation-mode)** - For fixes, features, and direct implementation

### 2. Learn the Monorepo Structure

Familiarize yourself with how our code is organized:

- **[Monorepo Structure](../architecture/monorepo-structure.md)** - High-level organization

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

Ensure you have the right tools configured:

- **[Development Tools](../tools/)** - Required tooling
- **[GitHub Integration](../tools/github-mcp-setup.md)** - GitHub workflow setup

## Daily Workflow

### Typical Development Cycle

1. **Receive a task** (issue, feature request, bug report)
2. **Choose the right operation mode** based on the task type
3. **Follow the appropriate workflow** (planning vs. implementation)
4. **Validate your changes** using our testing and formatting pipeline
5. **Submit your work** through our GitHub workflow

### Key Principles

- **Always format your code** - Our CI pipeline requires proper formatting
- **Test your changes** - Run validation before submitting
- **Follow naming conventions** - Consistency helps everyone
- **Keep changes focused** - Small, focused changes are easier to review

## Getting Help

### When You're Stuck

1. **Check the documentation** - Most questions are answered here
2. **Review similar issues** - Look at how similar problems were solved
3. **Ask the team** - Don't hesitate to reach out for guidance

### Common Resources

- **[Quick Commands](../reference/quick-commands.md)** - Essential commands you'll use daily
- **[Troubleshooting](../reference/troubleshooting.md)** - Solutions to common problems
- **[Rule Index](../reference/rule-index.md)** - Complete reference to all guidelines

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **[Dive deeper into operation modes](./operation-modes.md)** - Master the planning and implementation workflows
2. **[Explore the GitHub workflow](./github-workflow.md)** - Learn our issue and PR process
3. **[Understand the validation pipeline](./validation-pipeline.md)** - Ensure your code meets quality standards
4. **[Review best practices](../best-practices/)** - Learn proven approaches for common scenarios

## Pro Tips

- **Start with Plan-First Mode** when you're unsure - it's better to plan than to implement incorrectly
- **Use the validation commands** frequently - catch issues early
- **Keep commits focused** - one logical change per commit
- **Read the error messages** - they usually tell you exactly what to fix
