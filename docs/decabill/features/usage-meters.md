# Usage meters

Tenant-scoped usage meters drive arrear usage billing for service plans and addons.

## Catalog

`billing_meters` stores reusable meters per tenant:

- `key` (unique per tenant), `name`, optional `description` / `unit_label`
- `aggregator`: `max` | `min` | `avg` | `first` | `last` | `sum` | `sum_positive_deltas`
  - **Gauge-style:** `max` / `min` / `avg` / `first` / `last` over in-window samples
  - **`sum`:** total of sample values (volume / batch totals)
  - **`sum_positive_deltas`:** sum of increases between consecutive samples (time-ordered);
    on counter reset (value decreases), treat the new value as a fresh series and add it
    (Prometheus-style). Useful for cumulative provider counters.
- `default_unit_price_net`
- `is_active`

Admin API: `GET/POST /meters`, `GET/POST/DELETE /meters/{id}` (`catalog:read` / `catalog:write`).

Hard-delete is blocked while plan, addon, service-type, or usage rows reference the meter. Prefer `isActive=false`.

## Attachments

Meters attach to plans, addons, and service types via join tables with an optional unit-price override:

- `billing_service_plan_meters` — unique `(service_plan_id, meter_id)`
- `billing_addon_meters` — unique `(addon_id, meter_id)`
- `billing_service_type_meters` — unique `(service_type_id, meter_id)`

Each link stores `source` (`manual` | `module` | `provider`) and `required` (boolean). Required links cannot be detached; price overrides remain allowed.

**Effective price:** `coalesce(link.unit_price_net, meter.default_unit_price_net)`.

The same catalog meter may be attached to a plan and to one or more addons. Each attachment keeps its own effective price. Usage and invoice lines are **attachment-scoped**, not merged by `meterId`.

### Declared / required meters

- **Addon modules** (`implementationType=module`) may declare `meters` on the registered module. On addon create/update, Decabill ensures a catalog row by `key` (create if missing; never clobber existing catalog defaults) and sideloads links as `source=module`, `required=true`.
- **Providers / products** declare meters on provider metadata (`GET /service-types/providers`). On service-type create/update (and on meter list), Decabill sideloads them onto `billing_service_type_meters` as `source=provider`, `required=true`. Admins may attach additional manual meters on the service type.
- **Effective plan meters** = explicit plan attachments ∪ meters on the plan’s `serviceTypeId`. Inherited service-type meters appear on plan list/embed with `inherited=true` (no detach in plan UI). Recording `attachmentType=plan` accepts either explicit or inherited meters.
- **Collection interval:** optional `collectionIntervalMs` on each declared meter. When set (> 0), the meter-collect job pulls samples on that interval. Omitted meters stay push-only (admin / API key).

Nested APIs:

- `GET/POST /service-plans/{id}/meters`, `POST/DELETE /service-plans/{id}/meters/{meterId}`
- `GET/POST /addons/{id}/meters`, `POST/DELETE /addons/{id}/meters/{meterId}`
- `GET/POST /service-types/{id}/meters`, `POST/DELETE /service-types/{id}/meters/{meterId}`
- `GET /addons/modules` — registered modules including declared meters (admin preview)

`ServicePlanResponse` and `AddonResponse` embed attached meters (plans include inherited service-type meters).

## Recording usage

`POST /admin/usage/record` (admin or API key, `usage:write`):

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "...",
  "periodStart": "...",
  "periodEnd": "...",
  "meterId": "...",
  "value": 12.5,
  "attachmentType": "plan",
  "addonId": null,
  "usagePayload": {}
}
```

Rules:

- Prepaid plans (`billInAdvance`) reject metered recording.
- If the subscription has **no** plan-meter (including inherited service-type meters) and **no** billable addon-meter attachments, legacy payload-only bodies remain allowed (`totalCost` / `usageCost` / `units×unitPrice` on invoice).
- Otherwise `meterId` and `value` are required; `attachmentType` defaults to `plan`.
- `attachmentType=plan`: meter must be on the subscription’s plan or its service type.
- `attachmentType=addon`: `addonId` required; subscription must have that addon billable; meter must be on that addon.

Admin entry CRUD: `/admin/billing/subscriptions/{id}/meter-entries`.

## Collector job (pull)

BullMQ `meter-collect.coordinator` runs every minute (`BILLING_METER_COLLECT_INTERVAL`, default `60000`; disable with `BILLING_METER_COLLECT_ENABLED=false`). It fans out per-tenant `meter-collect.unit` jobs.

For each active arrear subscription (skip prepaid):

1. **Plan / provider path:** provisioned subscription item → resolve declared meters with `collectionIntervalMs` from the provider runtime module (override) or metadata → due when no prior `usageSource=collector` row or `now - last.periodEnd >= interval` → call `BillingProviderModule.collectMeters` **once per due meter** with that meter’s `periodStart`/`periodEnd` → write via `UsageService.createUsage` with `usageSource: collector` and `attachmentType: plan`.
2. **Addon / module path:** billable module addons → same due logic from `BillingAddonModule.meters` → optional `collectMeters` (also per due meter) → `attachmentType: addon`.

The tenant unit job pages through eligible subscriptions (`BILLING_METER_COLLECT_BATCH_SIZE`, default 500) until exhausted.

Idempotency is soft: due-check against the latest collector `periodEnd` for `(subscriptionId, meterId, attachmentType, addonId)`. Fail-closed: meters with an interval but no `collectMeters` implementation are skipped (warn log; no zero invent). Per-subscription and per-addon errors are isolated so one failure does not abort the tenant job.

Push (`POST /admin/usage/record`) and pull coexist; modules own their collection windows.

Built-in Hetzner / DigitalOcean register stub collectors (empty samples) until real metrics APIs are wired.

## Subscription views

- `GET /subscriptions/{id}/meters` and admin twin under `/admin/billing/subscriptions/{id}/meters`
- `SubscriptionResponse.meters` embeds the same summaries (effective price, period aggregate, estimated charge)
- `GET /subscriptions/{id}/meters/history?from&to&groupBy=day|month` (admin twin under `/admin/billing/subscriptions/{id}/meters/history`) — per-meter time series for the service details UI
- WebSocket `meterSummaryUpdate` on room `subscription:{id}` after usage mutations (see [Service details](./service-details.md))

## Invoice charge path (arrear)

For each charge period:

1. Effective plan meters (plan links ∪ service-type links) → aggregate entries with `attachmentType=plan` for that `meterId` → separate plan-scoped line
2. Each billable subscription addon → each of that addon’s meter attachments → aggregate with `attachmentType=addon` and that `addonId` → separate addon-scoped line
3. Same catalog meter on plan + addon A + addon B can produce up to three lines
4. If there are no plan/addon meter attachments at all → legacy `extractUsageCost` on the subscription base line

Period inclusion: a record settles into the charge period that contains its `periodEnd`
(left-open start, inclusive end). Spanning intervals are billed once, in the period where
the sample ends — not in both adjacent periods. Collector samples clamp `periodEnd` to the
subscription’s current `nextBillingAt` when collection runs after that boundary (before the
billing tick), and arrear schedule advances anchor the next `currentPeriodStart` at the prior
`nextBillingAt` so late ticks do not open a gap that drops samples. Invoice meter lines use
schedule-aligned `meterPeriodStart` (not lagged `invoice.createdAt`) so open-position
invoicing cannot skip post-boundary collector rows.

Empty aggregates become `0` and omit the line when below the minimum billable amount. Prepaid plans skip meter costs.
