# Customer Profiles

Billing metadata for invoice issuance and subscription ordering. One profile per user per tenant.

## Overview

Customer profiles store legal and contact information required for compliant invoices and Stripe customer records. Subscription creation rejects incomplete profiles with 400 Bad Request.

Profiles are managed through self-service endpoints for customers and admin CRUD for operators.

## Required Fields for Ordering

Before `POST /subscriptions`, the backend validates:

- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Address line
- City
- Country

Optional fields may include company name, customer type (business/consumer), VAT ID (with VIES validation status), postal code, and phone depending on deployment configuration and invoice issuer rules.

See [VAT and tax treatment](./vat-and-tax-treatment.md) for reverse-charge eligibility and cross-border rules.

## Self-Service

| Method | Path                                     | Purpose                         |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/customer-profile`                      | Retrieve current user's profile |
| POST   | `/customer-profile`                      | Create or update profile        |
| POST   | `/customer-profile/auto-billing/setup`   | Start payment-method setup      |
| POST   | `/customer-profile/auto-billing/enable`  | Enable auto-billing             |
| POST   | `/customer-profile/auto-billing/disable` | Disable auto-billing            |

The billing console exposes a customer profile page for authenticated users to complete or update billing details before ordering. Auto-billing controls live in the profile modal; see [Auto-Billing](./auto-billing.md).

### Stripe Integration

When the user initiates payment, the billing manager creates or updates a Stripe Customer and stores the Stripe customer id on the profile for subsequent checkout sessions. Setup sessions and successful Checkout payments can also store a default payment method for auto-billing.

## Admin Management

Admins manage profiles under `/admin/billing/customer-profiles`. See [Billing Administration](./billing-administration.md).
The same admin surface also exposes the [Customer Trust Score](./customer-trust-score.md) for operator review.

Rules:

- One profile per user
- Delete is blocked when the user has existing invoices or subscriptions
- Admin create is used when onboarding customers who cannot self-register

**Frontend route:** `/administration/customer-profiles`

## Validation Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Order[POST /subscriptions] --> Check{Profile complete?}
    Check -->|No| Reject[400 Bad Request]
    Check -->|Yes| Avail[Availability check]
    Avail --> Create[Create subscription]
    Issue[POST .../issue manual invoice] --> CheckIssue{Profile complete?}
    CheckIssue -->|No| RejectIssue[400 Bad Request]
    CheckIssue -->|Yes| Issued[Issue invoice]
```

Manual invoice issuance uses the same completeness rules for the target user.

Project bill-time (`POST /admin/billing/projects/{projectId}/bill-time`) also requires a complete profile for the project's assigned customer. See **[Projects](./projects.md)**.

## Data Storage

Profiles are stored in `billing_customer_profiles` in PostgreSQL, scoped by tenant through the user's `tenant_id`.

Sensitive fields follow standard application encryption and access controls. Stripe customer ids are stored for payment orchestration only.

## User Billing Day

The user's registration date (day of month, capped at 28) defaults as their **billing day** for open position accumulation. This is stored on the user record and is independent of the service plan's `billing_day_of_month`. See [Invoices](./invoices.md).
