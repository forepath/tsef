## Features

### [Authentication](./authentication.md)

Multiple authentication methods with configurable user registration. Supports API key, Keycloak OAuth2/OIDC, and built-in users with JWT.

**Key Capabilities**:

- Static API key for automation and single-operator deployments
- Keycloak OAuth2/OIDC for enterprise SSO
- Built-in user registration with email confirmation
- Password reset with 6-character alphanumeric codes
- Admin user management and optional signup disable

### [Multi-tenancy](./multi-tenancy.md)

Isolate billing data per tenant while sharing one billing manager deployment. Same email can register separately in each tenant.

**Key Capabilities**:

- `X-Tenant` header on HTTP and WebSocket requests
- `TENANTS` environment allowlist
- `TENANTS_ALLOW_DEFAULT=false` to exclude the implicit `default` tenant
- Per-tenant Stripe return URLs via `TENANT_FRONTEND_URLS`
- Optional `STATIC_API_KEY_TENANT_ID` to bind API key auth to one tenant

### [Numbering](./numbering.md)

Shared (default) or tenant-scoped pools for invoice, subscription, customer, and DATEV debtor numbers via `TENANTS_SHARED_NUMBERS`. Hostnames stay globally unique.

**Key Capabilities**:

- Default shared pools for simpler authority-facing uniqueness
- `TENANTS_SHARED_NUMBERS=false` for per-tenant number isolation
- Webhook `datev.debtor_range_exhausted` when DATEV debtor ranges run out

### [Subscriptions](./subscriptions.md)

Order service plans, manage lifecycle (cancel, resume), and provision cloud instances when the plan includes infrastructure. Optional promotion codes can be validated at checkout and redeemed on the new subscription.

**Key Capabilities**:

- Subscription creation with availability checks and provider config validation
- Optional `promotionCode` at order time (validated before submit)
- Cancel and resume with effective dates (`cancel_scheduled` vs final cancel)
- Mid-life [config change](./subscription-config-change.md) (server type up-/downgrade and addon add/remove)
- Subscription items with provisioning status and hostname reservation
- Usage records for usage-based pricing (arrear plans only)

### [Usage meters](./usage-meters.md)

Reusable tenant meters attached to plans and addons with optional unit-price overrides. Usage is recorded per attachment and billed as separate invoice lines.

**Key Capabilities**:

- Meter catalog CRUD (`max` / `min` / `avg` / `first` / `last` aggregators)
- Plan and addon attachments with coalesce pricing
- Attachment-scoped recording and admin meter-entry CRUD
- Separate invoice lines per plan/addon attachment; legacy payload fallback when no meters

### [Subscription Config Change](./subscription-config-change.md)

Modify the configuration of an active subscription: in-place server type resize and addon add/remove, with prorated billing and async BullMQ processing.

### [Automatic daily price recalculation](./automatic-price-recalculation.md)

Opt-in nightly refresh of service-plan catalog prices from the provider, with prorated subscription settlement, statutory withdrawal restart, and consolidated customer email.

### [Advance billing and yearly interval](./advance-billing-and-yearly-interval.md)

Plan flag `billInAdvance` for prepaid period charges, `year` billing interval, withdrawal accounting for unbilled vs invoiced advance debt, and related webhook/email events.

### [Marketing promotions](./promotions.md)

Tenant-scoped promotion codes with fixed discounts, free days, or free billing periods. Customers validate and redeem on `/promotions` or at subscription checkout; benefits apply automatically on invoice creation.
