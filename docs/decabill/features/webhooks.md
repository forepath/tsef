# Webhooks (Decabill)

Outbound webhook notifications let tenant administrators register HTTPS endpoints that receive structured billing events.

## Access

- **Admin UI:** `/webhooks` in the billing console (alongside user management)
- **REST API:** `/admin/billing/webhooks` (admin role or API key with `X-Tenant`)
- **Scope:** Endpoints and deliveries are stored per deployment database and scoped by `tenant_id`

## Authentication modes

Each endpoint supports:

| Mode            | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`          | No outbound auth header                           |
| `authorization` | Sets the `Authorization` header                   |
| `custom_header` | Sets a custom header name and value               |
| `query_param`   | Appends a query parameter (**GET** requests only) |

Forepath also signs each delivery with HMAC-SHA256 in the `Forepath-Signature` header.

## Event envelope

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "object": "event",
  "type": "invoice.issued",
  "created": "2026-07-14T14:00:00.000Z",
  "api_version": "2026-07",
  "application": "decabill",
  "tenant_id": "default",
  "client_id": "customer-user-uuid",
  "data": { "object": {} }
}
```

`client_id` is the customer user id when the event relates to a subscription, invoice, or project.

## Event catalog

Events are published from the **billing** service after successful mutations.

### Billing and subscriptions

- `invoice.created`, `invoice.issued`, `invoice.voided`
- `invoice.tax_mode_applied` (non-domestic tax modes at issue time)
- `payment.initiated`, `payment.succeeded`, `payment.failed`
- `payment.auto.initiated`, `payment.auto.retry_scheduled`, `payment.auto.exhausted`
- `auto_billing.enabled`, `auto_billing.disabled`
- `payment_method.attached`
- `customer_trust.level_changed`
- `subscription.created`, `subscription.updated`, `subscription.cancel_scheduled`, `subscription.canceled`, `subscription.resumed`, `subscription.period_charged`
- `addon.activated`, `addon.deactivated`, `addon.provision_failed`, `addon.teardown_failed`

Addon payloads include subscription id/number, plan id/name, addon id/key/name, and status timestamps. Config snapshots and secrets are never included. See [Addons](./addons.md).

Subscription payloads include `billInAdvance` and `billingIntervalType`. **Breaking:** cancel requests emit `subscription.cancel_scheduled`; `subscription.canceled` is reserved for final teardown. See [Advance billing and yearly interval](./advance-billing-and-yearly-interval.md).

Payment success/failure payloads may include `mode` (`checkout` | `auto`). Auto-billing events are documented in [Auto-Billing](./auto-billing.md).
`customer_trust.level_changed` only includes identifiers plus level and score metadata; it never includes billing-profile address fields or other PII.

### Projects

- `project.created`, `project.updated`, `project.deleted`

### Project milestones

- `milestone.created`, `milestone.updated`, `milestone.deleted`

### Project time entries

- `time_entry.created`, `time_entry.updated`, `time_entry.deleted`

### Project tickets

- `ticket.created`, `ticket.updated`, `ticket.deleted`
- `ticket.comment.created`

Ticket payloads include metadata only; full ticket body content is not included in webhook events.

**Subtasks:** Subtasks are tickets with a `parentId`. Adding a subtask publishes `ticket.created` (with `parentId`). Removing a subtask publishes `ticket.deleted`. Reparenting publishes `ticket.updated`. The parent ticket does not receive a separate event when children change.

**Comments:** Adding a comment publishes `ticket.comment.created`. There is no comment update/delete API, so no corresponding webhook events.

### DATEV exports

- `datev_export.started`, `datev_export.completed`, `datev_export.failed`
- `vat_id.validation_succeeded`, `vat_id.validation_failed`, `vat_id.validation_pending`, `vat_id.validation_unavailable`
- `oss.threshold_exceeded`

DATEV export events are tenant-scoped admin operations; `client_id` is omitted. Export file contents and storage paths are never included in webhook payloads.

### `datev_export.completed`

```json
{
  "id": "export-uuid",
  "scope": "tenant",
  "tenantId": "default",
  "periodYear": 2026,
  "periodMonth": 6,
  "status": "completed",
  "fileName": "datev-export-2026-06.zip",
  "bookingCount": 12,
  "invoiceCount": 4,
  "debtorCount": 3,
  "includedTenantIds": ["default"],
  "triggeredBy": "scheduler",
  "errorMessage": null,
  "startedAt": "2026-07-01T08:00:00.000Z",

  "createdAt": "2026-07-01T08:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-01T08:05:00.000Z"
}
```

`datev_export.failed` uses the same shape with `status: "failed"` and a populated `errorMessage`.

## Delivery and retries

Deliveries are queued on the `billing` BullMQ queue. Each delivery is retried up to **3 times** with exponential backoff (starting at 5 seconds). Every attempt is logged in the delivery history with its attempt number. The endpoint `consecutive_failures` counter increments only after all retries for an event are exhausted. Endpoints auto-disable after **10** consecutive failed events.

## Delivery log retention

Each webhook endpoint maintains its own delivery log. Retention is enforced **per endpoint** in two phases:

1. **Age-based:** Delete delivery rows older than the configured retention window.
2. **Count-based:** If the endpoint still has more rows than the configured maximum, delete the oldest excess entries (newest entries are kept).

| Setting          | Endpoint field             | Platform default                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Retention window | `deliveryLogRetentionDays` | `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` (30 days) |
| Max entries      | `deliveryLogMaxEntries`    | `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_LOG_MAX_ENTRIES` (500)        |

Set either field to `null` on update to revert to platform defaults. Omit both on create to use defaults immediately.

Pruning runs:

- After each delivery log insert (fire-and-forget, scoped to that endpoint)
- On a scheduled coordinator job (`webhook-delivery-retention.coordinator`, default every hour via `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_RETENTION_INTERVAL_MS`)
- Immediately when retention settings are changed on an endpoint

## Endpoint deletion

Deleting a webhook endpoint removes all associated delivery logs immediately (application-level cleanup plus database `ON DELETE CASCADE`). In-flight delivery jobs that finish after deletion skip persisting a delivery log rather than creating orphaned rows.

See [Billing Administration](./billing-administration.md) for other admin features.
