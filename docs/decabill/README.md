# Decabill Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Decabill**, the ForePath billing product for subscriptions, invoicing, payment processing, and customer billing administration.

## What is Decabill?

Decabill lets operators and customers manage billing in one place:

- **Subscriptions and service plans** with configurable providers and pricing
- **Invoicing and payments** including Stripe checkout flows
- **Customer self-service** for profiles, invoices, and subscription lifecycle
- **Administration** for manual invoices, customer billing profiles, and operational dashboards
- **Multi-tenant deployments** with tenant-scoped data and configurable frontends
- **Server provisioning** for bundled product stacks via cloud-init when service plans include infrastructure
- **Projects and project boards** for customer-assigned work, time tracking, and billable-hours invoicing
