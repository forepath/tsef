### By Rule Type

**MUST Rules** (Mandatory)

- Code formatting with `nx format:write`
- Following naming conventions
- Not editing generated files
- Using Nx commands for builds and tests

**SHOULD Rules** (Recommended)

- Making focused commits
- Running validation before pushing
- Using multiple small commits for reviewability
- Keeping changes scoped to the problem

**MAY Rules** (Optional)

- Adding comments for complex logic
- Including longer commit bodies
- Using scope in commit messages
- Referencing plugin ecosystem

## Rule Hierarchy

### Precedence Order

1. **AI Agent Rules** - Technical specifications for automated behavior
2. **Architecture Guidelines** - Structural principles and organization
3. **Development Workflows** - Process and procedure guidelines
4. **Best Practices** - Recommended approaches and quality standards

### Conflict Resolution

When rules conflict:

1. **AI Agent Rules take precedence** for automated behavior
2. **Architecture Guidelines** override general practices for structural decisions
3. **Development Workflows** guide process and procedure
4. **Best Practices** provide recommendations when no specific rule exists

## Rule Categories Explained

### Technical Rules (AI Agent Rules)

- **Purpose**: Define exact behavior for AI agents and automated systems
- **Format**: RFC 2119 compliant with MUST/SHOULD/MAY language
- **Audience**: AI agents, automated systems, developers implementing tooling
- **Examples**: Exact command usage, file editing restrictions, validation requirements

### Process Rules (Development Workflows)

- **Purpose**: Guide human developers through common processes
- **Format**: Narrative explanations with examples and context
- **Audience**: Human developers, team members, new contributors
- **Examples**: How to handle issues, when to use different modes, PR process

### Structural Rules (Architecture Guidelines)

- **Purpose**: Define how code should be organized and structured
- **Format**: Explanatory text with diagrams and examples
- **Audience**: All developers, architects, team leads
- **Examples**: Library organization, dependency patterns, naming conventions

### Quality Rules (Best Practices)

- **Purpose**: Promote high-quality, maintainable code and processes
- **Format**: Proven approaches with rationale and examples
- **Audience**: All developers, code reviewers, team members
- **Examples**: Testing strategies, code quality guidelines, review practices

## Rule Evolution

### How Rules Change

1. **Identify Need** - New requirement or problem emerges
2. **Propose Change** - Create issue or discussion about the rule
3. **Review Impact** - Consider effects on existing code and processes
4. **Update Rules** - Modify both AI agent rules and human-readable docs
5. **Communicate Change** - Notify team of rule updates
6. **Monitor Compliance** - Ensure new rules are being followed

### Rule Maintenance

- **Regular Review** - Periodically review rules for relevance and effectiveness
- **Feedback Collection** - Gather input from developers using the rules
- **Documentation Updates** - Keep both technical and human-readable docs in sync
- **Tool Integration** - Update automated tools to enforce new rules
