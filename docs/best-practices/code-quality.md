# Code Quality

Writing high-quality, maintainable code is essential for long-term project success. This guide covers the principles, practices, and tools that help ensure code quality in our monorepo.

## üéØ Quality Principles

### Simplicity First

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

- Solutions should be as simple as possible while meeting requirements
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering
- Prefer clear, straightforward approaches over clever but opaque solutions

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**

- Don't implement features or abstractions until they're actually required
- Focus on solving current problems, not hypothetical future ones
- Add complexity only when there's a proven need

### Maintainability and Readability

**Self-Documenting Code**

- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Write code that explains its purpose without comments
- Structure code logically and consistently

**Modular Design**

- Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces
- Each module should have a single, clear responsibility
- Minimize coupling between modules

### Testability

**Design for Testing**

- Write code that's easy to test in isolation
- Use dependency injection to enable mocking
- Separate business logic from framework-specific code

**Comprehensive Testing**

- Write tests for all critical functionality
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain high test coverage for important code paths

## üõ†Ô∏è Quality Tools

### Code Formatting

**Prettier Integration**

```bash
# Format all changed files
nx format:write

# Check formatting without making changes
nx format:check
```

**Benefits**:

- Consistent code style across the entire codebase
- Eliminates style debates and discussions
- Reduces cognitive load when reading code
- Prevents CI failures due to formatting issues

### Linting

**ESLint Configuration**

```bash
# Lint all projects
nx run-many -t lint

# Lint specific project
nx run-many -t lint -p PROJECT_NAME

# Fix linting issues automatically
nx run-many -t lint --fix
```

**What Linting Catches**:

- Potential bugs and logic errors
- Code style violations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Unused code and imports

### Testing

**Comprehensive Test Suite**

```bash
# Run all tests
nx run-many -t test

# Run tests for affected projects
nx affected -t test

# Run tests with coverage
nx run-many -t test --coverage
```

**Test Types**:

- **Unit Tests** - Test individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests** - Test how components work together
- **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete user workflows
- **Visual Tests** - Ensure UI components render correctly

## üìù Code Standards

### Naming Conventions

**Variables and Functions**

```typescript
// Good: Descriptive and clear
const userAccountBalance = calculateAccountBalance(userId);
const isValidEmailAddress = validateEmail(email);

// Bad: Unclear or abbreviated
const bal = calc(user);
const valid = check(email);
```

**Classes and Interfaces**

```typescript
// Good: Clear purpose and responsibility
class UserAccountService {
  async createAccount(userData: CreateUserRequest): Promise<UserAccount> {
    // Implementation
  }
}

// Bad: Vague or overly generic
class Manager {
  async do(user: any): Promise<any> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

**Files and Directories**

```typescript
// Good: Descriptive and consistent
user - account.service.ts;
user - account.component.ts;
user - account.interface.ts;

// Bad: Unclear or inconsistent
user.ts;
UserComponent.ts;
user_account_interface.ts;
```

### Function Design

**Single Responsibility**

```typescript
// Good: Each function has one clear purpose
function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}

function sendWelcomeEmail(email: string): Promise<void> {
  return emailService.send({
    to: email,
    subject: 'Welcome!',
    template: 'welcome',
  });
}

// Bad: Function does multiple things
function processUser(email: string): Promise<void> {
  // Validates email
  const isValid = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
  if (!isValid) throw new Error('Invalid email');

  // Sends email
  return emailService.send({
    to: email,
    subject: 'Welcome!',
    template: 'welcome',
  });
}
```

**Clear Parameters and Return Types**

```typescript
// Good: Explicit types and clear parameters
function calculateTotalPrice(items: CartItem[], taxRate: number, discountCode?: string): number {
  // Implementation
}

// Bad: Unclear types and parameters
function calc(items: any, tax: any, code?: any): any {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Error Handling

**Consistent Error Patterns**

```typescript
// Good: Specific error types and clear messages
class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(field: string, message: string) {
    super(`Validation failed for ${field}: ${message}`);
    this.name = 'ValidationError';
  }
}

function validateUser(user: User): void {
  if (!user.email) {
    throw new ValidationError('email', 'Email is required');
  }
  if (!isValidEmail(user.email)) {
    throw new ValidationError('email', 'Invalid email format');
  }
}

// Bad: Generic errors with unclear messages
function validateUser(user: any): void {
  if (!user.email) {
    throw new Error('Bad');
  }
}
```

**Graceful Degradation**

```typescript
// Good: Handle errors gracefully
async function loadUserData(userId: string): Promise<UserData | null> {
  try {
    return await userService.getUser(userId);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load user data:', error);
    return null; // Graceful fallback
  }
}

// Bad: Let errors bubble up without handling
async function loadUserData(userId: string): Promise<UserData> {
  return await userService.getUser(userId); // Could throw
}
```

## üß™ Testing Best Practices

### Test Structure

**Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**

```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('createUser', () => {
    it('should create a new user with valid data', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userData = {
        email: 'test@example.com',
        name: 'Test User',
      };
      const mockUserRepository = {
        save: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: '1', ...userData }),
      };
      const userService = new UserService(mockUserRepository);

      // Act
      const result = await userService.createUser(userData);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual({ id: '1', ...userData });
      expect(mockUserRepository.save).toHaveBeenCalledWith(userData);
    });
  });
});
```

**Descriptive Test Names**

```typescript
// Good: Clear what is being tested
it('should return null when user is not found', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

it('should throw ValidationError when email is invalid', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

// Bad: Unclear what is being tested
it('should work', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});

it('test user', async () => {
  // Test implementation
});
```

### Test Coverage

**Focus on Critical Paths**

- Test all business logic and decision points
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test integration points between components
- Don't test implementation details

**Coverage Goals**

- Aim for high coverage of critical functionality
- Don't sacrifice quality for coverage numbers
- Focus on testing the right things, not everything

## üîç Code Review Guidelines
