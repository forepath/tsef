# Best Practices Documentation

This section covers proven approaches, patterns, and guidelines that help ensure high-quality, maintainable code across our monorepo. These practices are based on real-world experience and industry standards.

## Overview

Best practices are essential for maintaining code quality, consistency, and team productivity. This documentation provides practical guidance for common scenarios and challenges you'll encounter in daily development.

## Documentation Structure

### [Code Quality](./code-quality.md)

Comprehensive guide to writing high-quality, maintainable code, including:

- Quality principles (KISS, YAGNI, DRY)
- Code formatting and linting standards
- Testing best practices and coverage guidelines
- Code review processes and standards

## Key Practice Areas

### Code Quality

- **Simplicity First** - Keep solutions as simple as possible
- **Self-Documenting Code** - Write code that explains itself
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Test critical functionality thoroughly
- **Consistent Standards** - Follow established patterns and conventions

### Development Workflow

- **Incremental Development** - Make small, focused changes
- **Continuous Validation** - Test and format code frequently
- **Clear Communication** - Document decisions and changes
- **Collaborative Review** - Use code reviews for knowledge sharing

### Architecture Patterns

- **Domain-Driven Design** - Organize code around business domains
- **Separation of Concerns** - Keep different responsibilities separate
- **Dependency Management** - Minimize and manage dependencies carefully
- **Reusable Components** - Build for reuse across the monorepo
