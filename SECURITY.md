# Security Policy

This policy applies to the **ForePath One** monorepo, which contains multiple products. Product-specific security documentation lives in each product docs tree. Use the links in **Security Resources** below for detailed registers, SBOM paths, and hardening notes.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of this framework:

| Version             | Supported |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| 2.x.x               | Yes       |
| 1.x.x               | No        |
| 0.x.x               | No        |
| Earlier major lines | No        |

Security updates are intended for supported **2.x.x** releases. Full disclosure and CRA-oriented context:

- **Agenstra:** [Supported versions and security updates](./docs/agenstra/security/vulnerability-reporting-and-artifacts.md#supported-versions-and-security-updates)
- **Decabill:** [Supported versions and security updates](./docs/decabill/security/vulnerability-reporting-and-artifacts.md#supported-versions-and-security-updates)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping this framework and its users safe.

### Bug bounty and compensation

**Forepath does not operate an official bug bounty program.** There are no published reward tiers, third-party bounty platforms, or guaranteed payouts for Agenstra, Decabill, or other products in this repository. Do not submit reports expecting a bounty.

We still welcome **valid, responsibly disclosed** vulnerabilities with a clear description, demonstrated impact, and reproducible steps. We may, at our **sole discretion**, offer recognition or compensation for especially valuable findings, but **no reward is promised or owed**, and any past payment does not establish a precedent.

**Automated and low-effort reports are discarded without review.** Mass scanner output, duplicated template submissions, and reports that are clearly **AI-generated** without manual verification and original analysis are rejected immediately. Invest time in one verified finding before contacting us.

### How to Report Security Issues

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to our security team:

- **Email**: soc@forepath.io
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Framework Vulnerability Report` (you may add the product name, for example `Agenstra` or `Decabill`, in the body)
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** - Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact** - Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Steps to Reproduce** - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Affected Versions** - Which versions of this framework are affected
5. **Suggested Fix** - If you have ideas for how to fix the issue
6. **Contact Information** - How we can reach you for follow-up

### Vulnerability Assessment Process

1. **Initial Response** - We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment** - Our security team will assess the vulnerability
3. **Investigation** - We'll investigate and validate the issue
4. **Fix Development** - We'll develop and test a fix
5. **Coordination** - We'll coordinate disclosure with you
6. **Release** - We'll release the fix and security advisory

### Recognition

We may acknowledge researchers who report **valid, verified** issues:

- **Acknowledgments** - Researchers may be credited in security advisories where appropriate
- **Responsible disclosure** - We coordinate fixes and disclosure timing with reporters of genuine issues
- **No guaranteed rewards** - See **Bug bounty and compensation** above; compensation is discretionary only

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- **Keep Dependencies Updated** - Regularly update all dependencies
- **Follow Security Guidelines** - Adhere to the project's code quality and security practices
- **Use Secure Coding Practices** - Follow secure coding principles
- **Regular Security Audits** - Perform regular security audits of your code

### For Organizations

- **Security Training** - Ensure your team is trained on security best practices
- **Regular Updates** - Keep this framework and all dependencies up to date
- **Security Monitoring** - Implement security monitoring and alerting
- **Incident Response** - Have an incident response plan in place

## Security Features

This framework includes several built-in security features:

### Built-in Security

- **Dependency Scanning** - Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD ([Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) on pull requests; see [CI security scanning](./docs/agenstra/security/ci-security-scanning.md))
- **Security Headers** - Default security headers for web applications
- **Input Validation** - Built-in input validation and sanitization
- **Authentication Patterns** - Secure authentication and authorization patterns

### Security Tools Integration

- **Trivy** - Repository, IaC/config, secret, and container image scanning in CI ([`trivy.yaml`](./trivy.yaml); CRITICAL fail gate; SARIF to GitHub Security when enabled)
- **npm audit** - Integrated dependency vulnerability scanning
- **ESLint Security Rules** - Security-focused linting rules
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Format, lint, test, build, and **Trivy** filesystem/config scans ([`tools/ci/trivy-pre-commit.sh`](./tools/ci/trivy-pre-commit.sh); requires Trivy on `PATH`)
- **CI/CD Security Gates** - Automated security validation in pull request checks (Trivy); release workflow publishes SBOMs without re-scanning

## Documented security deviations (accepted risks)

The products intentionally depart from stricter baselines in a few places. Each item below is **accepted** with compensating measures and a **review cadence**. Expanded register entries live in the product security docs linked below.

## Security Resources

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

We publish CycloneDX SBOM files for each release (Nx service SBOMs and Trivy container image SBOMs). Each product publishes to its own object-store bucket under the same key layout.
